    "* Amazon EC2 provides the following features:\n",
    "    * Virtual computing environments, <b>known as instances</b>\n",
    "    * Preconfigured templates for your instances, <b>known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</b>, that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software)\n",
    "    * Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, <b>known as instance types</b>\n",
    "    * Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop or terminate your instance, <b>known as instance store volumes</b>\n",
    "    * Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), <b>known as Amazon EBS volumes</b>\n",
    "    * Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, <b>known as Regions and Availability Zones</b>\n",
    "    * Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, <b>known as Elastic IP addresses</b>\n",
    "    * Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network, <b>known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)</b>\n",
    "* <b>Instances</b>: An instance is a virtual server in the cloud. Its configuration at launch is a copy of the AMI that you specified when you launched the instance. An <b>instance type</b> essentially determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute and memory capabilities. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html\n",
    "* <b>AMI</b>: Amazon Web Services (AWS) publishes many Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that contain common software configurations for public use(similar to docker image). All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS, which means that the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume, or backed by instance store, which means that the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3.\n",

    "    * Creating an Instance Store-Backed Linux AMI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html\n",
    "* <b>Regions</b>: Region is a separate geographic area. Each Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. \n",
    "* <b>Availability Zones</b>: Each Region is completely independent. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a Region are connected through low-latency links.\n",
    "* <b>Amazon EC2 Root Device Volume</b>: 这两类Volume相当于在AMI中安装的基础软件打包做成Snapshot，存储在不同地方\n",
    "    * Instance Store-backed Instances: Instances that use instance stores for the root device automatically have one or more instance store volumes available, with one volume serving as the root device volume. When an instance is launched, the image that is used to boot the instance is copied to the root volume. \n",
    "    * Amazon EBS-backed Instances: Instances that use Amazon EBS for the root device automatically have an Amazon EBS volume attached. When you launch an Amazon EBS-backed instance, we create an Amazon EBS volume for each Amazon EBS snapshot referenced by the AMI you use. \n",
    "* <b> Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</b>: Amazon VPC enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined, known as a virtual private cloud (VPC). \n",

    "        * Monitoring Lambda Applications: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/troubleshooting.html\n",
    "    * Function – A script or program that runs in AWS Lambda. Lambda passes invocation events to your function. The function processes an event and returns a response. \n",
    "        * Handler – Handler is the function AWS Lambda calls to start execution of your Lambda function. You identify the handler when you create your Lambda function. When a Lambda function is invoked, AWS Lambda starts executing your code by calling the handler function. AWS Lambda passes any event data to this handler as the first parameter.\n",
    "        * Context – AWS Lambda also passes a  context  object to the handler function, as the second parameter. Via this context object your code can interact with AWS Lambda.\n",
    "        * Logging – Your Lambda function can contain logging statements. AWS Lambda writes these logs to CloudWatch Logs. \n",
    "        * Exceptions – Your Lambda function needs to communicate the result of the function execution to AWS Lambda. Depending on the language you author your Lambda function code, there are different ways to end a request successfully or to notify AWS Lambda an error occurred during execution.\n",
    "        * Concurrency – When your function is invoked more quickly than a single instance of your function can process events, Lambda scales by running additional instances. Each instance of your function handles only one request at a time, so you don't need to worry about synchronizing threads or processes.\n",
    "    * Runtimes – Lambda runtimes allow functions in different languages to run in the same base execution environment. You configure your function to use a runtime that matches your programming language. \n",
    "    * Layers – Lambda layers are a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies. Layers let you manage your in-development function code independently from the unchanging code and resources that it uses. \n",
    "    * Event source – An AWS service, such as Amazon SNS, or a custom service, that triggers your function and executes its logic. \n",
    "    * Downstream resources – An AWS service, such as DynamoDB tables or Amazon S3 buckets, that your Lambda function calls once it is triggered.\n",
    "    * Log streams – While Lambda automatically monitors your function invocations and reports metrics to CloudWatch,\n",
    "    * AWS SAM – A model to define serverless applications. AWS SAM is natively supported by AWS CloudFormation and defines simplified syntax for expressing serverless resources. \n",
    "* <b>AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)</b>: The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS. A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks. Note that a serverless application is more than just a Lambda function—it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings. \n",

    "    * AWS SAM command line interface (AWS SAM CLI). You use this tool to build serverless applications that are defined by AWS SAM templates.\n",
    "* <b>AWS Serverless Application Repository</b>: The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find, deploy, and publish serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the <i>AWS Management Console, the AWS SAM command line interface (AWS SAM CLI), or AWS SDKs</i> to upload your code. Along with your code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as an AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.\n",

    "        * <i>When you launch an instance, we allocate a primary private IPv4 address for the instance. Each instance is also given an internal DNS hostname that resolves to the primary private IPv4 address; for example, ip-10-251-50-12.ec2.internal. You can use the internal DNS hostname for communication between instances in the same network, but we can't resolve the DNS hostname outside the network that the instance is in.</i>\n",

    "        * <i>Each instance that receives a public IP address is also given an external DNS hostname; for example, ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com. We resolve an external DNS hostname to the public IP address of the instance outside the network of the instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance. The public IP address is mapped to the primary private IP address through network address translation (NAT).</i>\n",
    "        * <i>A public IP address is assigned to your instance from Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses, and is not associated with your AWS account. When a public IP address is disassociated from your instance, it is released back into the public IPv4 address pool, and you cannot reuse it.</i>\n",
    "    * Elastic IP Addresses: An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address that you can allocate to your account. You can associate it to and from instances as you require, and it's allocated to your account until you choose to release it.\n",

    "* <b>AWS Site-to-Site VPN</b>: By default, instances that you launch into an Amazon VPC can't communicate with your own (remote) network. You can enable access to your remote network from your VPC by attaching a virtual private gateway to the VPC, creating a custom route table, updating your security group rules, and creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN (Site-to-Site VPN) connection. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/index.html\n",
    "    * Virtual Private Gateway: A virtual private gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection. You create a virtual private gateway and attach it to the VPC from which you want to create the Site-to-Site VPN connection.\n",
    "    * Customer Gateway: A customer gateway is a physical device or software application on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection. To create a Site-to-Site VPN connection, you must create a customer gateway resource in AWS, which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device.\n",
    "* <b>Amazon API Gateway</b>: Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications (apps). Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers. API Gateway is an AWS service that supports: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/index.html\n",

After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action. You can configure listener rules to route requests to different target groups based on the content of the application traffic. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html\n",
    "        * Network Load Balancers: A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html\n",
    "        * Classic Load Balancers(Not recommend): A load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.
