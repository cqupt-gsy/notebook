    "* <b><i>Container Infrastructure Management service (Magnum)</i></b>: The Container Infrastructure Management service codenamed (magnum) is an OpenStack API service developed by the OpenStack Containers Team making container orchestration engines (COE) such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Mesos available as first class resources in OpenStack. Magnum uses Heat to orchestrate an OS image which contains Docker and Kubernetes and runs that image in either virtual machines or bare metal in a cluster configuration. https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/stein/index.html\n",
