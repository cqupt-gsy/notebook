    "### Spring Cloud Config \n",
    "* Provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With the Config Server, you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments.\n",
    "* You can disable the bootstrap process completely by setting `spring.cloud.bootstrap.enabled=false`\n",
    "* <b>Spring Cloud Config Server</b>: \n",
    "    * the default strategy for locating property sources is to clone a git repository (at spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri) and use it to initialize a mini SpringApplication. The mini-application’s Environment is used to enumerate property sources and publish them at a JSON endpoint with following format:\n",
    "        * /{application}/{profile}[/{label}]\n",
    "        * /{application}-{profile}.yml\n",
    "        * /{label}/{application}-{profile}.yml\n",
    "        * /{application}-{profile}.properties\n",
    "        * /{label}/{application}-{profile}.properties\n",
    "        * `application is injected as the spring.config.name` in the SpringApplication, `profile is an active profile` (or comma-separated list of properties), and `label is an optional git label` (defaults to master.)\n",
    "    * Where should you store the configuration data for the Config Server? The strategy that governs this behaviour is the EnvironmentRepository, serving Environment objects. This Environment is a shallow copy of the domain from the Spring Environment (including propertySources as the main feature). The Environment resources are parametrized by three variables and explore it as an endpoint let client side download:\n",
    "        * {application}, which maps to spring.application.name on the client side.\n",
    "        * {profile}, which maps to spring.profiles.active on the client (comma-separated list).\n",
    "        * {label}, which is a server side feature labelling a \"versioned\" set of config files.\n",
    "        * creates an Environment from application.yml (shared between all clients) and {application}.yml (with {application}.yml taking precedence). If the YAML files have documents inside them that point to Spring profiles, those are applied with higher precedence (in order of the profiles listed). If there are profile-specific YAML (or properties) files, these are also applied with higher precedence than the defaults.\n",
    "    * Supported Repository: Git Backend, Version Control Backend Filesystem(CVS, SVN), File System Backend, Vault Backend, JDBC Backend, through {profile} determining the type\n",
    "    * <b>Spring Cloud Bus</b> Push Notifications when config in remote server(Github, Gitlab, Gitee, or Bitbucket) has been changed: example: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus\n",
    "* <b>Spring Cloud Config Client</b>: \n",
    "    * The default behavior for any application that has the Spring Cloud Config Client on the classpath is as follows: When a config client starts, it binds to the Config Server (through the `spring.cloud.config.uri` bootstrap configuration property) and initializes Spring Environment with remote property sources. The net result of this behavior is that all client applciations that want to consume the Config Server need a bootstrap.yml (or an environment variable) with the server address set in spring.cloud.config.uri (it defaults to \"http://localhost:8888\").\n",
    "    * If you prefer to use DiscoveryClient to locate the Config Server, you can do so by setting `spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled=true`. The net result of doing so is that client applications all need a bootstrap.yml with the appropriate discovery configuration（`Spring Cloud Netflix and Eureka Service Discovery` or `Spring Cloud Consul`）. \n",
    "        * <i>For example, with Spring Cloud Netflix, you need to define the Eureka server address (for example, in eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone). The price for using this option is an extra network round trip on startup, to locate the service registration. The benefit is that, as long as the Discovery Service is a fixed point, the Config Server can change its coordinates. The default service ID is configserver, but you can change that on the client by setting spring.cloud.config.discovery.serviceId.</i>\n",
    "    * The Config Service serves property sources from /{name}/{profile}/{label}, where the default bindings in the client app are as follows:\n",
    "        * \"name\" = \\${spring.application.name}\n",
    "        * \"profile\" = \\${spring.profiles.active} (actually Environment.getActiveProfiles())\n",
    "        * \"label\" = \"master\"\n",
    "        * You can override all of them by setting spring.cloud.config.* (where * is name, profile or label). Label can also be provided as a comma-separated list. In that case, the items in the list are tried one by one until one succeeds. This behavior can be useful when working on a feature branch. For instance, you might want to align the config label with your branch but make it optional (in that case, use spring.cloud.config.label=myfeature,develop).\n",
    "* Bootstrap context from config server > local application.yml > local bootstrap.yml(only use for configing config server) \n",
    "* Normal Spring application context behavior rules apply to property resolution: properties from a child context override those in the parent, by name and also by property source name\n",
    "* EnvironmentChangeEvent refresh @ConfigurationProperties, @RefreshScope refresh @Configuration\n",
    "    * POST to /actuator/env to update the Environment and rebind @ConfigurationProperties and log levels.\n",
    "    * /actuator/refresh to re-load the boot strap context and refresh the @RefreshScope beans.\n",
    "    * /actuator/restart to close the ApplicationContext and restart it (disabled by default).\n",
    "    * /actuator/pause and /actuator/resume for calling the Lifecycle methods (stop() and start() on the ApplicationContext).\n",

The proxy uses Ribbon to locate an instance to which to forward through discovery. All requests are executed in a hystrix command, so failures appear in Hystrix metrics.

    "* <b>RabbitMQ Binder</b>: 引入`spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit`或`spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit`可以集成该组件，可以解释为RabbitMQ消息中间件的客户端，By default, the RabbitMQ Binder implementation maps each destination to a TopicExchange.

This project provides starters for either an AMQP broker or Kafka as the transport. \n",
    "* <b>Spring Cloud Config Server</b>的一种实现方式\n",
