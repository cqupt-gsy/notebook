    "# Spring Data JPA\n",
    "* 参考文档：https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/2.1.1.RELEASE/reference/html/\n",
    "* Strict configuration uses details on the repository or the domain class to decide about Spring Data module binding for a repository definition:\n",
    "    * If the repository definition extends the module-specific repository, then it is a valid candidate for the particular Spring Data module.\n",
    "    * If the domain class is annotated with the module-specific type annotation, then it is a valid candidate for the particular Spring Data module. Spring Data modules accept either third-party annotations (such as JPA’s @Entity) or provide their own annotations (such as @Document for Spring Data MongoDB and Spring Data Elasticsearch).\n",
    "* Using multiple persistence technology-specific annotations on the same domain type is possible and enables reuse of domain types across multiple persistence technologies. However, Spring Data can then no longer determine a unique module with which to bind the repository.\n",
    "* The resolution algorithm starts by interpreting the entire part (AddressZipCode) as the property and checks the domain class for a property with that name (uncapitalized). If the algorithm succeeds, it uses that property. If not, the algorithm splits up the source at the camel case parts from the right side into a head and a tail and tries to find the corresponding property\n",
    "* `Pageable`：To find out how many pages you get for an entire query, you have to trigger an additional count query. By default, this query is derived from the query you actually trigger.\n",
    "    * The results of query methods can be limited by using the first or top keywords, which can be used interchangeably. An optional numeric value can be appended to top or first to specify the maximum result size to be returned.\n",
    "    * If pagination or slicing is applied to a limiting query pagination (and the calculation of the number of pages available), it is applied within the limited result.\n",
    "* Spring is instructed to scan com.acme.repositories and all its sub-packages for interfaces extending Repository or one of its sub-interfaces. For each interface found, the infrastructure registers the persistence technology-specific FactoryBean to create the appropriate proxies that handle invocations of the query methods. Each bean is registered under a bean name that is derived from the interface name, so an interface of UserRepository would be registered under userRepository.\n",
    "* If you use namespace configuration, the repository infrastructure tries to autodetect custom implementation fragments by scanning for classes below the package in which it found a repository. These classes need to follow the naming convention of appending the namespace element’s repository-impl-postfix attribute to the fragment interface name. This postfix defaults to Impl. The following example shows a repository that uses the default postfix and a repository that sets a custom value for the postfix.\n",
    "* entity-manager-factory-ref and transaction-manager-ref\n",
    "    * 一个entity-manager-factory对应一个DataSource，一个transaction-manager对应一个entity-manager-factory，因此一个数据库只对应一个事务管理器\n",
    "    * Explicitly wire the EntityManagerFactory to be used with the repositories being detected by the repositories element. Usually used if multiple EntityManagerFactory beans are used within the application. If not configured, Spring Data automatically looks up the EntityManagerFactory bean with the name entityManagerFactory in the ApplicationContext.\n",
    "    * Explicitly wire the PlatformTransactionManager to be used with the repositories being detected by the repositories element. Usually only necessary if multiple transaction managers or EntityManagerFactory beans have been configured. Default to a single defined PlatformTransactionManager inside the current ApplicationContext."
